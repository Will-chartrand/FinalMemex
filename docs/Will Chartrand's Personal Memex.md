Welcome to my memex!

---

#### What you can expect:

For this second memex, I chose to dive deeper into the history of the telegraph, as well as other communication technologies around the early 1900s. 

The main themes surround that of a few assigned readings - namely The Victorian Internet, and The People's Network. In addition to the history of these technologies, I also wanted to explore the societal impacts that they had a the time of their invention as well as the resulting impacts that we experience today. For this, I chose  a text titled Media Technology and Society. 

Everything that has been added for this second installment of the memex has been tagged with #PartTwo .
