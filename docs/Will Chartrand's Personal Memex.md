Welcome to my memex!

---

#### What you can expect:

For this second memex, I chose to dive deeper into the history of the telegraph, as well as other communication technologies around the early 1900s. 

The main themes surround that of a few assigned readings - namely The Victorian Internet, and The People's Network. In addition to the history of these technologies, I also wanted to explore the societal impacts that they had a the time of their invention as well as the resulting impacts that we experience today. For this, I chose  a text titled Media Technology and Society. 

Everything that has been added for this second installment of the memex has been tagged with #PartTwo . 

The summaries of the texts are included in the source files, which can be found in the Sources folder (or just click on the links included in this file)

It's unfortunate that the pictures don't appear on the website, I felt that they added a lot to some of the notes

As for linking other peoples' memexes, I do so in the notes:

- [[Morse Code]]
- [[techno-imperialism]]
