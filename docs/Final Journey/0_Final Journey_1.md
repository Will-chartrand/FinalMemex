Over the course of this term, I have explored many different ideas and technologies that surround the birth of the internet as we know it today, starting from the very beginning. From punch cards used for looms to the military and amateur computer networks that have changed the social climate drastically, we have covered an impressive amount of history in a very short time. As each one of these new forms of technology were introduced in class, I was intrigued about the social consequences that these developments had, and how they impact us today. With investigating these consequences, there was always one recurring idea that altered my conceptualization of such events. This idea is the concept of "space time" collapse. With each new form of communication allowing the spread of information to become more vast as well as efficient, different communities became closer together ideologically. The physical obstruction, distance, became less of a barrier for communication. Another example of this historically would be the Silk Road, which allowed China to trade with the West more easily. The difficulty of travelling between countries diminished slightly along with the information barrier since people could travel between countries easier.



### Note One - Samuel Morse

- [[docs/Thoughts/Samuel Morse]]


Samuel Morse is best known for creating a method of efficient telegraphical communication known as Morse Code, where each letter of the english alphabet is represented with a string of ones and zeroes. 

This revolutionary technology allowed for long-distance communication in a matter of seconds and was a crucial step towards the development of the internet. An interesting consequence of having such instantaneous communication between different geographical regions is that cities now had to use one standard time instead of their own local times. Before the telegraph, each city had its own agreed upon time, but with this newfound ability, it became necessary to standardize time to prevent confusion. This led to the creation of what we now refer to as time zones and a universal time standard which we still use to this day.

Morse's invention highlights the idea of "space-time" collapse, as it allowed for people to communicate across such vast distances in an instant, "collapsing" the physical barriers of distance. This led to the creation of a global community, where people could communicate and share information across different lands regardless of where they were in the world. Morse's telegraph and the subsequent development of Morse Code played an integral role in the advent of the internet, as it laid the foundation for the rapid exchange of information across vast distances.

### Note Two - Morse Code

- [[Morse Code]]

Since I used the previous note to talk about the physical developments of the space-time collapse that is the telegraph and Morse Code, I will use this space to discuss the social and economic effects that this innovation had on every day life. 

One of the most significant impacts of the telegraph was on commerce and trade, as it allowed for the rapid exchange of information and transactions between different regions and countries.

Prior to this technology, transactions were made almost exclusively using written letters or in-person meetings. It was typical that these transactions would take anywhere from a couple weeks to several months to complete. The telegraph changed all of that, allowing for real-time communication between different continents.

The telegraph also had great effects in politics and various governmental ordeals. It made it easier for these governments to communicate, and it played a key role in the negotiation of international treaties and agreements. Militaries predominantly used Morse Code for telegraphical communication after its inception. 

As we learned in class, there were many forms of long-distance communication that were used before Morse Code, such as the semaphor. Holding up flags and such up to certain angles to convey a message just wasn't the most effective thing in the world as a clear sight between the sender and receiver was needed.  Naturally, this new technology began to be used by military powers all over the world, not only through telegraph cables but also wireless radio broadcasts to communicate to battleships and such. 

### Note Four - Public annotations from @standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999

- [[docs/Thoughts/Public annotations from @standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999]]

In this text, Standage goes into very great detail about the first inter-continental submarine telegraph lines.

This line was laid across the Atlantic Ocean in the mid 1900s, connecting North America and Europe for the first time. The construction of the transatlantic telegraph was a ground-breaking feat of engineering and required the laying of thousands of miles of cable across the ocean floor, which took multiple attempts, as Standage made abundantly clear. The person initially in charge of this project was named Whitehouse, and was described as "completely incompetent", and was not at all qualified to lead such an expensive endeavour. 

The telegraph completely changed how these two continents communicated, allowing for essentially instantaneous transmission of messages across the ocean. Instead of getting information across by word of mouth through sailing across the ocean, this space-time collapse made it infinitely easier and faster to communicate. This had impacts on politics, the economies of both continents, and society as a whole, as it allowed for the exchange of information and ideas in a way which was previously unimaginable.

the transatlantic telegraph was a major leap forward in how the world communicates. It laid the foundation for the introduction of the internet and other forms of digital communication that we use today, and it serves as a reminder of the power of technology to connect people across vast distances.

### Note Three - Binary Encoding

- [[Binary Encoding]]

One of the most major contributions to the collapse of "space-time" is the advent of binary encoding. With the ability to encode and transfer data of any kind in a standardized and effective manner, the possibility of sending media other than just english characters through computer networks really had an astounding affect on society. This found important uses in accounting and business, as documents could now be sent as [[Facsimile]] through the internet.

In addition to facsimile, binary encoding also led to the development of multimedia communication, allowing for the transmission of audio, video, and images over the internet. This had a profound impact on the way we communicate and consume media, as well as how and what media was created online. The development of the World Wide Web and email also helped to further collapse space-time, making it possible for people to communicate with each other instantly, regardless of their physical location.

Another consequence of the collapse of space-time is the increased global interconnectedness and the emergence of a global culture. With the rise of social media and other communication technologies, people from different parts of the world are now able to connect with each other and share ideas in ways that were once impossible. This has led to the creation of a global community where people can learn from each other and work together to solve global problems.


### Note Five - Effects of Instantaneous Communcation

With all of the technological innovation that has taken place within the last couple-hundred years, it's amazing to see how far we have come as a bunch of monkeys in shoes. However, even with how much easier our lives have become with instantaneous communication and information accessibility, it's important to realize that the collapse of space-time also has its drawbacks and consequences, especially in the modern day with how far out of proportion it has been taken. For example, the constant connection to literally the entirety of human knowledge can lead to information overload. The fast pace of communication as well as the changing information landscape can also compell people to not take as much time to reflect think critically, as people are often more focused on responding quickly than on taking the time to consider their thought processes and ideas.

in addition to this, the collapse of space-time has also led to concerns about privacy and security, as personal information can be easily accessed and shared online. In more recent years, the protocols that govern how data is transferred has become safer with encryption standards, but it is often human error which leads to the compromisation of our data ([[Societal Effects of Computer Viruses]]). The rise of cybercrime and the potential for cyber attacks threaten the livelihood of individuals and society as a whole.

With both of these highlighted issues, I think a resolution could be found in a greater advocation of critical thinking. Over time we have allocated less and less time to thinking about our beliefs and ideas, which not only makes it easier for people's views to tend to specific ideologies which in turn causes needless divide, but it diminishes our attention span drastically. We're constantly looking for the next video or internet meme to stimulate our reward systems as if we're little rats in cages, pushing the dopamine button until we eventually succumb to the neglection of bodily necessities and die of starvation. 

Anyhow, the collapse of "space-time" is a complex and interesting concept that I have personally found to be very interesting and transformative with how I view history and the world as a whole. As technology continues to evolve and increase in complexity, it is of utmost importance to consider the potential consequences that it may have on society ([[docs/Sources/@kaczynskiIndustrialSocietyIts1995]]). In using technology, we interact with a physical and social system that we have only the slightest comprehension of, and the consequences of doing so are just as enigmatic.
