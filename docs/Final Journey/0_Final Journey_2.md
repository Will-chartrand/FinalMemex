At the start of the course, I wrote in the tutorial level:
> If I had to select some keywords to describe my aim for this course, they would be: History, how the internet formed, what technologies are used.


As a computer science major, I became more interested in the technologies themselves and social consequences of such innovations rather than the social and cultural environments prior that shaped their developments. However, seeing as the internet has become such a large component of our every day lives today I set out to explore the effects that technology has had in recent years. I think that during the dawn of the internet culture played an important role in shaping how the internet would function, but since then the roles have more or less inverted themselves, and now it is technology which shapes culture instead of the other way around. 

To navigate through the assessment of the accomplishment of my original desires, I chose to start with the societal affects of the internet and will work my way to the newer technologies that the web is built with today. 


### Note One - Effects of Instantaneous Communication

[[docs/Thoughts/Effects of Instantateous Communication]]

In the beginning, technology was more of a tool used to bring local communities closer together. This changed drastically with the advent of inter-continental communication, and even inter-country communication. The communities formed locally, facilitated by bulletin boards became much more than local as everyone from all over the world would be able to contribute. Thus, [[Internet Communities]] were born. 

These Internet communities began to spring up in various forms, ranging from online forums and bulletin boards (like an extension of the once local digital bulletin boards like what's seen in [[1-inbox/@doubCOMMUNITYMEMORYPRECEDENTS|COMMUNITY MEMORY: PRECEDENTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND MOVEMENTS]]) to social media platforms and online gaming communities. They provided a platform for people to connect with others who shared similar interests, hobbies, and even beliefs.

In this note, I made an effort to outline the negative impacts that technology of this kind has had on society. Due to this instant, effortless nature, information can be easy replicated, communicated and altered. As information became so easily accessible, our brains have adapted to the contant inflow of information and our reward systems have tuned themselves accordingly, prioritizing short term dopamine releases over long term goals. This idea manifested itself in the form of online social networking with websites such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Our attention spans have clearly suffered from this technology's properity.

I often go on Youtube (one of these instant gratification media sites) and recently I began watching a video of Doctor K (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ) explain how out attention in the modern world got decimated in the first place, and he challenged his viewers to sit and stare at a wall for an hour without any distractions. So that's what I did, and it was very difficult. I don't know why I'm bringing this up, perhaps I wanted to give a personal anecdote regarding our lack of attention these days. 

### Note Two - Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy

- [[docs/Sources/@foddyGettingItBennett2017]]

This note was used to describe the [[Effects of Instantateous Communication]], as it's a video game who's concept is more or less about sticking to a challenge without changing tasks once the objective becomes too daunting or difficult. As information became a "vast digital landfill" as opposed to a vast "digital landscape" descibed by Frana in the next source, it has become much easier to quit and spend your time on easier things.

Getting Over It reflects this struggle by providing an extremely daunting challenge (climbing a mountain) that requires intense focus and dedication to overcome. It forces players to confront their tendency to give up when things get tough and to push themselves to new limits.

However, the effects of instantaneous communication go beyond just our ability to persevere in video games. The constant stream of information and distractions can make it difficult to concentrate on tasks and to stay motivated in the face of adversity. With so much content available to us through our laptops, television, and even our phone (which most of us take absolutely everywhere), it can be tempting to abandon difficult projects or goals in favor of more easily digestible content.

### Note Three - Before The Web There Was Gopher

- [[docs/Thoughts/Part 3/Public annotations from @franaWebThereWas]]

This source really dives deep into the information technology known as Gopher. 

Gopher was used for retrieving documentation in internet protocol networks ([[TCP-IP]]). It was the predecessor of the internet as we know it today, and quickly fell off as a result of the dawn of the World Wide Web. As a historical text, I found this one the most interesting. As for my desire to learn about the technologies in the internet, it's certainly crucial to understand what came before the modern technologies we see today.

Additionally, studying the explosive rise and dramatic decline of Gopher has given me insights into the evolution of the internet and how the technology we interact with can and does change rapidly over time. Gopher's demise highlights the importance of adapting to changing technologies and the ever-changing force that is consumer demand in the tech industry. As a computer science student, I have heard and learned about many different technologies, many of which become obsolete and/or are replaced within the span of months, sometimes weeks. The number of times I have had trouble with developing software using a certain outdated version of it is incredible. The technologies we use are constantly updated and features that had been standard are now depreciated and unsupported, with new, upgraded implementations taking their place. Reading this text really illuminates the fact that the development of the internet has always been fast-paced, and this is a key point of its history that was very much realised for me through this research. 

The article also delves into the technical aspects of Gopher, such as its use of hierarchical menus and the Gopher protocol which allowed clients to research and retrieve documents with ease. It's fascinating to learn about the technical limitations of Gopher and how the culture surrounding it drove the development of the web in a certain direction. For example, Gopher lacked any real graphical capabilities natively, which caused people to opt for using graphical web browsers such as Mosaic, even if using such a technology came at the expense of having a less hierarchical structure governing its content.

### Note Four - Website Technologies

- [[docs/Thoughts/Part 3/Website Technologies]]

As mentioned previously, there are many new technologies constantly being developed. In the field that I'm interested, software and web developement, these technologies often come in the form of tools that aid in the process of development. Technologies such as NextJS are built on top of another technology, ReactJS, which are built on top of another technology, JavaScript. Often times it's just turtles all the way down. 

What I failed to mention in this note is the fact that the web as a concept occasionally goes through major shifts. In the beginning, the web was very static without many interactive elements at all. This changed with the advent of client-side javascript which allowed web developers to add some form of control flow to elements as they are interacted with. 

Another major trend in web development is the rise of progressive web apps (PWAs). PWAs are applications that can be installed on a client's device like a native app, but are actually built using web technologies. An example of this kind of technology would be Electron. Things like VSCode and Obsidian itself is made using web technologies. They are designed to provide a seamless user experience, with fast loading times and offline capabilities, and are becoming increasingly popular as more and more people access the web through their smartphones.
