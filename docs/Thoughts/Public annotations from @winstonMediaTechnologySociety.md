> Schilling’s contribution, it will be remembered, was not just to use the galvanometer but also to understand that encoding the messages was the clue to efficiency. Binary codes were not new but again date back to antiquity; and in the sixth book of The Advancement and Proficiency of Learning (1604) Bacon gives an example of one, using the letters A and B as the binary base (Thompson 1947:311).

> Newspapers became avid consumers of telegrams, which had a considerable effect on their contents.
>
>> The telegraph as well as facsimile had a tremendous impact on the contents of newspapers at the time. This was due to the fact that this information was able to be sent across larger distances much faster.
