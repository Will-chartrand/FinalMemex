A **Leyden jar** is an [electrical component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_component "Electrical component") that stores a high-voltage [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") (from an external source) between [electrical conductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) on the inside and outside of a glass jar. It typically consists of a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with the inner foil. It was the original form of the [capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar#cite_note-Dummer-1) (also called a _condenser_).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar#cite_note-Duff-2)
