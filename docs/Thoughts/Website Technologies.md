Over the years, more and more of what have come to be known as "frameworks" have started to be introduced to the web development landscape. 

Websites are typically made with three main "languages": HTML (HyperText Markup Lanugage), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. 

Typically when I create websites, I use [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js), which is a framework for [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) which is a library for Javascript. As with many things in computing, it's a technology which is based off of a plethora of other technologies which themselves are based off of a plethora of other technologies. In addition to Next.js, I use TailWindCSS, which is a framework for CSS. It makes inline styling look much nicer and more concise in the code. 

In regard to website hosting, a very popular option is to use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), which is an Amazon service. There are also free options such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which I personally use to host my websites.
