Morse code (Developed by [[Samuel Morse]]) was a form of communicating over sending signals over a single wire. It did this by assigning short sequences of dots and dashes to each character of the alphabet, as well as the other [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters.

The image above depicts the commonly used characters and their morse code equivalent.

Something that I hadn't thought about, which was brought up it [Eric Desrosier's Memex](https://glng3r.github.io/memex/website/My%20Own%20Ideas/Linguistics%20and%20meaning/) is that this type of encoding could really only be used by the societies which utilized a latin script because other scripts rely heavily on intonation to convey meaning. Thus, most asian countries would find an implementation of Morse code to be disadvantageous since many words can mean various different things depending on how you say them. 

Morse code can be transmitted or perceived in various ways - namely through electricity, [[Electromagnetic Radiation]] and sound. The morse code that is sent over the radio is done so through ER, but encoded as sound to be later received and heard through a speaker of some kind. This is similar to how it was done over a wire as wel.
