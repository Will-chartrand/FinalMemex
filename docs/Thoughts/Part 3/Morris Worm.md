The Morris Worm, better known as the Internet Worm of 1988, was one of the oldest computer viruses ever created.

This worm was written by Robert Morris on November 2nd 1988. It worked by infecting computers through the internet and replicating, spreading to other computers. The attack was launched from the MIT network.

The virality of this worm was unintional, as he created it to serve as a proof of concept. However, a mistake was made in the code which allowed the worm to infect a machine even if it had been infected already. This resulted in a very large scale [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack, and $100,000 - $10,000,000 in damages.
