The **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**) is one of the main [protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") of the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite"). It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP "TCP/IP"). TCP provides [reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking) "Reliability (computer networking)"), ordered, and [error-checked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction "Error detection and correction") delivery of a [stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_byte_stream "Reliable byte stream") of [octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing) "Octet (computing)") (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"), [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email"), [remote administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_administration "Remote administration"), and [file transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_transfer "File transfer") rely on TCP, which is part of the [Transport Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer") of the TCP/IP suite. [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") often runs on top of TCP.

TCP is [connection-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication "Connection-oriented communication"), and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent. The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established. Three-way handshake (active open), [retransmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks) "Retransmission (data networks)"), and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering) "Latency (engineering)"). Applications that do not require reliable [data stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream "Data stream") service may use the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP) instead, which provides a [connectionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication "Connectionless communication") [datagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram "Datagram") service that prioritizes time over reliability. TCP employs [network congestion avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control "TCP congestion control"). However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including [denial of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack"), [connection hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_sequence_prediction_attack "TCP sequence prediction attack"), TCP veto, and [reset attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_reset_attack "TCP reset attack").
