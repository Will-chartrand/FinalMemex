Robert Tappan Morris is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur, known for creating the Morris Worm, one of the first computer worms to gain significant media attention. Born in 1965, Morris graduated from Harvard University in 1987 with a degree in computer science. In 1988, he developed the Morris Worm while studying for his PhD at Cornell University. The worm was intended to measure the size of the internet at the time, but it had unintended consequences, infecting thousands of computers and causing significant disruption to the nascent internet.

Morris was later prosecuted for his role in creating the worm, and he became the first person to be convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He was sentenced to three years of probation, 400 hours of community service, and a fine of $10,000. Morris went on to become a successful entrepreneur, co-founding several technology companies, including Viaweb (which was later acquired by Yahoo!) and Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that has helped launch companies such as Dropbox and Airbnb. Morris's experience with the Morris Worm has been widely cited as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of computer security vulnerabilities.
