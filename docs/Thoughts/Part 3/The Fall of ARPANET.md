ARPANET's popularity began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One reason for this decline was the emergence of newer, more user-friendly networks, such as the World Wide Web. The web provided a more intuitive interface and allowed for easy navigation, making it accessible to a wider audience than Arpanet's command-line interface. Though before this, the National Science Foundation Network [replaced ARPANET as the backbone of the internet in 1989](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/ARPANET)

Another reason for Arpanet's decline in popularity was the growing concern about security and privacy. As Arpanet's user base expanded, so did the potential for unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Security protocols were put in place, but they were often difficult to use and had limited effectiveness. As a result, many users began to look for alternatives that provided better security features. Additionally, concerns about privacy increased as more people began to use Arpanet for personal communication. While Arpanet was designed primarily for research and academic purposes, it was also being used for personal and commercial communication, which led to concerns about data privacy and confidentiality. Overall, the combination of a less user-friendly interface and security and privacy concerns contributed to Arpanet's decline in popularity.
