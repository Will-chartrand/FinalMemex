> The Web epitomized the fluid and opaque postmodernist ethos. Gopher, by contrast, cleaved to the classical-modernist aesthetic of technology as one-dimensional, systematic, and transparent, with “depths that can be plumbed and understood.”

> The first attempt to design a CWIS on the University of Minnesota campus, however, quickly degenerated into what microcomputer and workstation programmer Farhad Anklesaria later called “a classic design-by-committee monstrosity.”12 The fight over the CWIS between mainframe and personal computing proponents briefly turned ugly

> The Internet, by the late 1980s, had become an exponentially growing mass of poorly classified data available mainly by using nonintuitive software.

>> The sub-optimal interface for sifting through this ever-growing mountain of data became one of the more significant bottlenecks in this system

> Then, late in 1992, Fred Barrie and Steve Foster at the University of Nevada at Reno introduced Veronica (for “Very Easy RodentOriented Netwide Index to Computerized Archives,” a pun on the Archie comic book series48) making it easy to search large numbers of gopher servers rapidly
>
>> Archie was not named after the comic book, though it's succeeding engines adopted the names of Archie comic book characters such as Veronica and JugHead

> If you use gopher to make money, then the U of Minn wants something in return. ... I know that the UofMN will take a moderate stance on these matters. ... Greed would kill gopher, believe me ...

>> The commercialization of Gopher may have ultimately been what killed it

> It would be nice to be clear on which of the vast assemblage of code that has gone into the Gopher project has a U Minnesota copyright on it, which is effectively uncopyrighted, and which is available under a GNU or similar license.
>
>> The lack of clarity on the legal documents is indicative of myopic commercialization efforts

> Advertising, McCahill has said, “made for a perfect environment for WWW, because with the graphic-heavy pages, there is a great place to put your ads.” Multimedia capabilities made the Web visually exciting if not necessarily more informative.
>
>> Having that vibrant graphical facet to the information landscape would surely make the World Wide Web more attractive to the average, less technologically inclined person.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Widespread use of inline graphics to create visually rich pages make sense as an advertising vehicle since the aim is not to create a quickly traversable information hierarchy. Gopher directories make it possible to locate pertinent information relatively quickly.

> Limited bandwidth initially conspired against browsers like Mosaic too. Graphics-laden Web pages in 1993 could easily take 30 seconds to several minutes to download.

> If you really care about pretty graphics, HTML is the wrong place to do this. At least early incarnations were completely wrong. We really liked [Adobe] PDF because you got absolute control over layout, location, and all that stuff.6
