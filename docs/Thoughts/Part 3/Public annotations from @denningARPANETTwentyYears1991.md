> n the fall of 1969, the first node of the computer network known as the ARPANET was installed at UCLA. By December of that year, four nodes were operating, by 1971 fifteen nodes, and by 1973 thirty-seven nodes. Today, this network has evolved into a collection of networks called the Research Intemet spanning over 60,000 nodes.

It has institutionalized a system of rewards that reflects the high value it places on individual (academic) freedom and accomplishment: emphasis on research over teaching, a concern to identify the unique personal contribution of each participant in joint work, a focus of research within rather than across disciplines, a distrust of students collaborating on homework, and disregard for skills needed to work effectively in organizations.

> This discourse is baffled by complaints of students who say that they graduate without practical competence in their disciplines, without the ability to learn new subjects, and without a sense that their research is relevant to the world.

>> Often the university's role is to provide information and resources to aid in one's own educational pursuits. I don't think such institutions should bear the responsibility of making the students "useful to society".
