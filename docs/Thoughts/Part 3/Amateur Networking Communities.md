### The First Computer-Operated Community Bulletin Board

A project by the name of Community Memory was the first ever Computer-Operated bulletin board system (BBS). In Berkeley, California during the early 1970s, a group of computer enthusiasts (university drop-outs/social activists) banded together to create a system that would allow the average person to explore and post on a completely digital bulletin board system. They did this by setting up a computer terminal in a public space, and allowed members of the public to interact with it.

It helped to demonstrate the potential of computers as a tool for community building and communication. The project also paved the way for later online communities and social networks, which have become an important part of modern life. Today, the legacy of the Community Memory project can be seen in a wide range of online platforms and tools that enable people to connect with each other, share information, and collaborate on projects.
