Flame wars refer to heated arguments or discussions that take place in online forums, social media platforms, or chat rooms. These exchanges are characterized by aggressive and inflammatory language, personal attacks, and insults, often resulting in a prolonged exchange of hostile comments. Flame wars can start over a variety of issues, including politics, religion, sports, or any topic that people feel passionately about.

Flame wars can have negative consequences for both individuals and communities. They can create a hostile and toxic environment that drives away users who are looking for meaningful discussions. Flame wars can also lead to cyberbullying, harassment, and psychological harm.

The term isn't used as often now as it was during the dawn of the internet, but even though we have stopped describing interactions as such, they still are prevalent.
The internet provides individuals with a unique sense of anonymity that can't be found in real life. When hiding behind a screen, voicing your negative opinions about someone or something becomes easier, since the online identity that you've created for yourself isn't directly linked with your in-person identity.
