ARCHIE, which was named after a misspelling of the word "ARCHIVE" is an early search engine developed in the late 1980s by a group of students at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. The ARCHIE search engine was designed to locate and retrieve files that were stored on anonymous FTP servers, which were prevalent at the time. Unlike other search engines that searched for text on web pages, ARCHIE searched for filenames and directory structures on FTP servers.

ARCHIE's search algorithm was simple yet effective. It would search for files based on keywords or phrases entered by the user and return a list of matches along with the location and size of the files. The search results were displayed in a hierarchical format, with directories listed first, followed by the files contained within them. This would allow for more effective navigation of the results. ARCHIE quickly gained popularity among the academic community, as it provided an easy way to access a vast repository of research material that was otherwise difficult to find. However, with the advent of the World Wide Web and more advanced search technologies, ARCHIE's popularity waned, and it was eventually replaced by newer search engines.

Archie was not originally named after the Archie comic book series, but later developments in this technology took on the names of the series' characters, such as Jughead and Veronica.
