Over the years, many different types of computer virusus have been made:
- Spyware
- Trojan horses
- Adware
- Root kits
- Worms
- Keyloggers
- Ransomwares

Many of these viruses aim to get different things out of the computer or the individual such as money, information, or even the computing resources for mining cryptocurrencies. 

But what effect does this have on the users who are getting stolen from? Well it all started with the first computer virus, the [[Morris Worm]]. It clearly did enough damage to raise a substantial concern on the matter. Software companies have since created antiviruses and things of that nature, though it's still not impossible for your own computer to be hacked. People did what people do best though, which is adapt. It's fairly easy to avoid getting hacked if you don't click on shady links. But at the same time, people also do the other thing that they do best, which is be kinda dumb. So unfortunately, it's very common for people to download and run malicious executables, especially the less tech savvy people (old people). 

In the consumer market though, Windows has a built in antivirus called Windows Defender which works pretty well. 

In many cases, the weakest link in digital security happens to be the user. Joseph Macnamara's third memex touches on how someone fell victim to a social engineering attack in which someone impersonated a Radon company worker and gave him an executable file (https://jmcn99.github.io/hist1900-memex/idea_notes/human%20aspect%20of%20cybersecurity/). Regardless of how secure a digital system may be, there will always be human error that may be taken advantage of.
