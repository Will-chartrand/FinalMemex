The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) created a network that came to be known as ARPANET. The computers were first connected in 1969, and the system was declared as operational in 1971.

In the very beginning, there were only four computers connected to this network but this number quickly grew due to the rising demand, so much so that amateur engineers began creating their own networks.

ARPANET at first used NCP (network control protocol) but later switched to using [[TCP-IP|TCP/IP]] due to it being a more effective standard for tranferring data.
