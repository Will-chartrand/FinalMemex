### Summary & Key Take Aways

The Community Memory project was an early experiment in public computing and online community building that took place in Berkeley, California in the early 1970s. The project was started by a group of computer enthusiasts and social activists who wanted to create a system that would allow people to share information and communicate with each other using computers. They set up a computer terminal in a public space, where anyone could come and use it to post messages, read messages posted by others, and search for information on a wide range of topics. The system was designed to be easy to use, even for people with little or no computer experience, and it quickly became popular among the local community.

Key Take Aways:
- Great technological and societal advancement in regards to digitized networking can be in part attributed to the amateur computing scene. 
- It may have been the large organizations who funded the development of the technology, but once it gets into the hands of the public, it is the people who shape its place in society.
