### Summary & Key Take Aways

The modem world is the modern era of telecommunications and information technology that began in the mid-20th century and continues to this day. The modem world is characterized by the widespread use of digital technologies, including computers, mobile devices, and the internet. Kevin Driscoll talks about how in the beginning, only the tech-savvy people could communicate to others using their modem, which created a fairly close-knit (culturally, not physically) of computer enthusiasts. 

It rings especially true today that technologies have transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, creating new opportunities for innovative ideas, collaboration, projects, and global connectivity.
