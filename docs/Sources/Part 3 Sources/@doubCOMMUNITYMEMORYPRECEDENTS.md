### Summary & Key Take Aways

The Community Memory project was an early experiment in public computing and online community building that took place in Berkeley, California in the early 1970s. Doub explains that the project was started by a group of computer enthusiasts and social activists who wanted to create a system in which people could share information and communicate with each other using computer terminals. They set up a computer in a public space, where any member of the public could use it to post messages, read messages posted by others, and search for information on a wide range of topics. The system was designed to be easy to use, even for people with little or no computer experience, and it quickly became popular among the local community.

Key take aways:

- This local bulletin board became a place where people could communicate with others that had similar interests. The Community Memory project brought the local community closer together, and computer networking became another facet of the social world.
- Localized computer networks can complement a social environment, though it's clear that in recent times the scaling of such networks can have a negative impact.
