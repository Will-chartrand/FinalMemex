### Summary & Key Take Aways

Gopher was a protocol used mainly for searching through large amounts of information through interenet protocols which has since become obsolete. It was somewhat of a precursor to the World Wide Web, which we use today. Unlike the web that we see now, Gopher presented information in a very hierarchical manner, which made finding documentation rather straight forward and efficient. Frana describes how in the 1990s, Gopher had been released and gained massive success and attention from the academic community and elsewhere in the few years that followed. However, this success quickly faded as the World Wibe Web took its place not long after. 

Key take aways:

- Gopher was an incredibly useful software that made researching online much more straight-forward.
- The World Wide Web became more popular due to its ability to natively display images and other forms of media.
