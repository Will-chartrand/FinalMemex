### Summary & Key Take Aways

Denning describes the origins of ARPANET and it's first successful implementation in 1969. The rapid growth in computer networking in the following twenty years altered the societal role that computing had immensly.

ARPANET seeked a more effective protocol for data transfer and [[TCP-IP]] was developed as a result. All ARPANET nodes migrated from NCP to this new protocol, which became a standard that is still in use to this day. 

Key take aways:

- The origins of computer networking can be found in ARPANET's development
- The internet grew rather quickly. 
- [[ARPANET Main Figures]]
