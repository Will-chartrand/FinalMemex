From punch cards used for looms to the military and amateur computer networks that have changed the social climate drastically, we have covered an impressive amount of history in a very short time. As each one of these new forms of technology were introduced in class, I was intrigued about the social consequences that these developments had, and how they impact us today. With investigating these consequences, there was always one recurring idea that altered my conceptualization of such events. This idea is the concept of \"space time\" collapse. With each new form of communication allowing the spread of information to become more vast as well as efficient, different communities became closer together ideologically. The physical obstruction, distance, became less of a barrier for communication. Another example of this historically would be the Silk Road, which allowed China to trade with the West more easily. The difficulty of travelling between countries diminished slightly along with the information barrier since people could travel between countries easier.</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_1/#note-one-samuel-morse","title":"Note One - Samuel Morse","text":"<ul> <li>docs/Thoughts/Samuel Morse</li> </ul> <p>Samuel Morse is best known for creating a method of efficient telegraphical communication known as Morse Code, where each letter of the english alphabet is represented with a string of ones and zeroes. </p> <p>This revolutionary technology allowed for long-distance communication in a matter of seconds and was a crucial step towards the development of the internet. An interesting consequence of having such instantaneous communication between different geographical regions is that cities now had to use one standard time instead of their own local times. Before the telegraph, each city had its own agreed upon time, but with this newfound ability, it became necessary to standardize time to prevent confusion. This led to the creation of what we now refer to as time zones and a universal time standard which we still use to this day.</p> <p>Morse's invention highlights the idea of \"space-time\" collapse, as it allowed for people to communicate across such vast distances in an instant, \"collapsing\" the physical barriers of distance. This led to the creation of a global community, where people could communicate and share information across different lands regardless of where they were in the world. Morse's telegraph and the subsequent development of Morse Code played an integral role in the advent of the internet, as it laid the foundation for the rapid exchange of information across vast distances.</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_1/#note-two-morse-code","title":"Note Two - Morse Code","text":"<ul> <li>Morse Code</li> </ul> <p>Since I used the previous note to talk about the physical developments of the space-time collapse that is the telegraph and Morse Code, I will use this space to discuss the social and economic effects that this innovation had on every day life. </p> <p>One of the most significant impacts of the telegraph was on commerce and trade, as it allowed for the rapid exchange of information and transactions between different regions and countries.</p> <p>Prior to this technology, transactions were made almost exclusively using written letters or in-person meetings. It was typical that these transactions would take anywhere from a couple weeks to several months to complete. The telegraph changed all of that, allowing for real-time communication between different continents.</p> <p>The telegraph also had great effects in politics and various governmental ordeals. It made it easier for these governments to communicate, and it played a key role in the negotiation of international treaties and agreements. Militaries predominantly used Morse Code for telegraphical communication after its inception. </p> <p>As we learned in class, there were many forms of long-distance communication that were used before Morse Code, such as the semaphor. Holding up flags and such up to certain angles to convey a message just wasn't the most effective thing in the world as a clear sight between the sender and receiver was needed.  Naturally, this new technology began to be used by military powers all over the world, not only through telegraph cables but also wireless radio broadcasts to communicate to battleships and such. </p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_1/#note-four-public-annotations-from-standagevictorianinternetremarkable1999","title":"Note Four - Public annotations from @standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999","text":"<ul> <li>docs/Thoughts/Public annotations from @standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999</li> </ul> <p>In this text, Standage goes into very great detail about the first inter-continental submarine telegraph lines.</p> <p>This line was laid across the Atlantic Ocean in the mid 1900s, connecting North America and Europe for the first time. The construction of the transatlantic telegraph was a ground-breaking feat of engineering and required the laying of thousands of miles of cable across the ocean floor, which took multiple attempts, as Standage made abundantly clear. The person initially in charge of this project was named Whitehouse, and was described as \"completely incompetent\", and was not at all qualified to lead such an expensive endeavour. </p> <p>The telegraph completely changed how these two continents communicated, allowing for essentially instantaneous transmission of messages across the ocean. Instead of getting information across by word of mouth through sailing across the ocean, this space-time collapse made it infinitely easier and faster to communicate. This had impacts on politics, the economies of both continents, and society as a whole, as it allowed for the exchange of information and ideas in a way which was previously unimaginable.</p> <p>the transatlantic telegraph was a major leap forward in how the world communicates.

With the ability to encode and transfer data of any kind in a standardized and effective manner, the possibility of sending media other than just english characters through computer networks really had an astounding affect on society. This found important uses in accounting and business, as documents could now be sent as Facsimile through the internet.</p> <p>In addition to facsimile, binary encoding also led to the development of multimedia communication, allowing for the transmission of audio, video, and images over the internet. This had a profound impact on the way we communicate and consume media, as well as how and what media was created online. The development of the World Wide Web and email also helped to further collapse space-time, making it possible for people to communicate with each other instantly, regardless of their physical location.</p> <p>Another consequence of the collapse of space-time is the increased global interconnectedness and the emergence of a global culture. With the rise of social media and other communication technologies, people from different parts of the world are now able to connect with each other and share ideas in ways that were once impossible.

However, even with how much easier our lives have become with instantaneous communication and information accessibility, it's important to realize that the collapse of space-time also has its drawbacks and consequences, especially in the modern day with how far out of proportion it has been taken. For example, the constant connection to literally the entirety of human knowledge can lead to information overload. The fast pace of communication as well as the changing information landscape can also compell people to not take as much time to reflect think critically, as people are often more focused on responding quickly than on taking the time to consider their thought processes and ideas.</p> <p>in addition to this, the collapse of space-time has also led to concerns about privacy and security, as personal information can be easily accessed and shared online. In more recent years, the protocols that govern how data is transferred has become safer with encryption standards, but it is often human error which leads to the compromisation of our data (Societal Effects of Computer Viruses). The rise of cybercrime and the potential for cyber attacks threaten the livelihood of individuals and society as a whole.</p> <p>With both of these highlighted issues, I think a resolution could be found in a greater advocation of critical thinking. Over time we have allocated less and less time to thinking about our beliefs and ideas, which not only makes it easier for people's views to tend to specific ideologies which in turn causes needless divide, but it diminishes our attention span drastically. We're constantly looking for the next video or internet meme to stimulate our reward systems as if we're little rats in cages, pushing the dopamine button until we eventually succumb to the neglection of bodily necessities and die of starvation. </p> <p>Anyhow, the collapse of \"space-time\" is a complex and interesting concept that I have personally found to be very interesting and transformative with how I view history and the world as a whole. As technology continues to evolve and increase in complexity, it is of utmost importance to consider the potential consequences that it may have on society (docs/Sources/@kaczynskiIndustrialSocietyIts1995). In using technology, we interact with a physical and social system that we have only the slightest comprehension of, and the consequences of doing so are just as enigmatic. </p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-docssourcesfoddygettingitbennett2017-and-docsthoughtspart-3website-technologies","title":"The Journey Between docs/Sources/@foddyGettingItBennett2017 and docs/Thoughts/Part 3/Website Technologies","text":"<ul> <li>docs/Thoughts/Effects of Instantateous Communication</li> <li>docs/Sources/@foddyGettingItBennett2017</li> <li>docs/Thoughts/Part 3/Public annotations from @franaWebThereWas</li> <li>docs/Thoughts/Part 3/Website Technologies</li> </ul> <p>At the start of the course, I wrote in the tutorial level:</p> <p>If I had to select some keywords to describe my aim for this course, they would be: History, how the internet formed, what technologies are used.</p> <p>As a computer science major, I became more interested in the technologies themselves and social consequences of such innovations rather than the social and cultural environments prior that shaped their developments.

This changed drastically with the advent of inter-continental communication, and even inter-country communication. The communities formed locally, facilitated by bulletin boards became much more than local as everyone from all over the world would be able to contribute. Thus, Internet Communities were born. </p> <p>These Internet communities began to spring up in various forms, ranging from online forums and bulletin boards (like an extension of the once local digital bulletin boards like what's seen in COMMUNITY MEMORY: PRECEDENTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND MOVEMENTS) to social media platforms and online gaming communities. They provided a platform for people to connect with others who shared similar interests, hobbies, and even beliefs.</p> <p>In this note, I made an effort to outline the negative impacts that technology of this kind has had on society. Due to this instant, effortless nature, information can be easy replicated, communicated and altered. As information became so easily accessible, our brains have adapted to the contant inflow of information and our reward systems have tuned themselves accordingly, prioritizing short term dopamine releases over long term goals. This idea manifested itself in the form of online social networking with websites such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

It was the predecessor of the internet as we know it today, and quickly fell off as a result of the dawn of the World Wide Web. As a historical text, I found this one the most interesting. As for my desire to learn about the technologies in the internet, it's certainly crucial to understand what came before the modern technologies we see today.</p> <p>Additionally, studying the explosive rise and dramatic decline of Gopher has given me insights into the evolution of the internet and how the technology we interact with can and does change rapidly over time. Gopher's demise highlights the importance of adapting to changing technologies and the ever-changing force that is consumer demand in the tech industry. As a computer science student, I have heard and learned about many different technologies, many of which become obsolete and/or are replaced within the span of months, sometimes weeks. The number of times I have had trouble with developing software using a certain outdated version of it is incredible. The technologies we use are constantly updated and features that had been standard are now depreciated and unsupported, with new, upgraded implementations taking their place. Reading this text really illuminates the fact that the development of the internet has always been fast-paced, and this is a key point of its history that was very much realised for me through this research. </p> <p>The article also delves into the technical aspects of Gopher, such as its use of hierarchical menus and the Gopher protocol which allowed clients to research and retrieve documents with ease. It's fascinating to learn about the technical limitations of Gopher and how the culture surrounding it drove the development of the web in a certain direction. For example, Gopher lacked any real graphical capabilities natively, which caused people to opt for using graphical web browsers such as Mosaic, even if using such a technology came at the expense of having a less hierarchical structure governing its content.</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#note-four-website-technologies","title":"Note Four - Website Technologies","text":"<ul> <li>docs/Thoughts/Part 3/Website Technologies</li> </ul> <p>As mentioned previously, there are many new technologies constantly being developed. In the field that I'm interested, software and web developement, these technologies often come in the form of tools that aid in the process of development. Technologies such as NextJS are built on top of another technology, ReactJS, which are built on top of another technology, JavaScript. Often times it's just turtles all the way down. </p> <p>What I failed to mention in this note is the fact that the web as a concept occasionally goes through major shifts. In the beginning, the web was very static without many interactive elements at all. This changed with the advent of client-side javascript which allowed web developers to add some form of control flow to elements as they are interacted with. </p> <p>Another major trend in web development is the rise of progressive web apps (PWAs). PWAs are applications that can be installed on a client's device like a native app, but are actually built using web technologies. An example of this kind of technology would be Electron. Things like VSCode and Obsidian itself is made using web technologies. They are designed to provide a seamless user experience, with fast loading times and offline capabilities, and are becoming increasingly popular as more and more people access the web through their smartphones.</p>"},{"location":"Lecture/5%20-%20Codes/","title":"5   Codes","text":"<p>The multiple human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write.

The calipers - one part made of brass, the other part with iron; had been interested in what happened to the legs in the presence of lightenning, but the legs would twitch when the two prongs touched the nerve. Felt that this was indicative of an 'animal force' (Shown diagram of frog with electrode in leg)</p> <p>On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened.</p> <p>In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion. Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, who was officially present during this experiment, was so alarmed that he died of fright soon after his return home. Newgate Calendar</p> <p>Let's talk about what the Greeks were doing before this frog stuff:</p> <p>What is it: The precise use of the word 'electric' and 'electricity' varies over the centuries, but starts getting used more or less in our sense in 16th, 17th century. Many individual observations over the years to do with attraction versus repelling, and the seeming interaction with magnets; all of it very mysterious. William Gilbert in 16th century observed how static electricity could attract a needle/lodestone; he framed it in the language of the 'humours' of the body, and especially as 'exhalation' - there's always been a connection between electricity and life, even when we didn't actually know that there was a connection between electricity and life.</p> <p>Can we store it? 1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek invents the Leyden jar - crazy set up. He was trying to capture static electricity - has a glass phial or jar of water, hanging from a gun barrel by a wire through the cork in the top, where the wire goes into the bottle; gun barrel is suspended by silk near glass balls that have been thoroughly rubbed up full of static electricity. The assistant touches the phial, gets a terrible amplified shock - we now call this a capacitor, a device for storing up electricity for release</p> <p>How fast does electricity flow? Jean Antoine Nollet, also in 1746 wants to know how fast this electric force can travel. Arranges for 200 monks to stand in a circle, each holding one end of a metal rod which combined gives the circle a 1 mile radius. Then he electrified one of the monks by getting him to touch a Leyden jar (recently invented), hoping to see how fast the effect traveled by the monk's reaction. He had to conclude travels vritually instantly! Does the same thing again with 180 royal guards for the edification of Louis XV. Science!</p> <p>Ben Franklin, roughly the same time, notices that an iron point can conduct electricity away from a charged iron sphere; does his famous kite experiment to demonstrate that static electricity and lightening are of the same kind of thing; develops lightening rods to protect buildings and ships</p> <p>The idea that the stuff travels instantly, and can be channeled in various ways is emerging. People start using fluid metaphors.</p> <p>There starts to develop the idea that something is moving, like a fluid.</p> <p>Alessandro Volta, 1745-1827 becomes aware of Galvani's experiments, and disagrees vehemently with him - V notes that experiment was with different medals through a moist body (recently deceased) - argues that the electrical current was a function of the interplay of moisture and the two different metals, NOT some innate animal force. To prove this, experiments and finds if he arranges two different kinds of metals in a pile of wet/dry/wet etc he can induce electricity to flow - calls this the 'pile'. Which we now call a 'battery'. 1800</p> <p>Implication: we can now experiment with a constant current rather than static - which helps kick start systematic experiments and obersvation &amp; research into electricity.</p> <p>While I haven't described them, many researchers also noting the way electricity influences/influence by magnetism. -Orsted works out some of the relationship of flowing electricity to magnetic fields, can deflect a nearby needle - people immediately start thinking 'hot damn we could make a telegraph out of this!'</p> <ul> <li>Faraday shows that a magnet can induce electricity in 1831; but over in the US, engineer Joseph Henry discovered this at roughly the same time (but Faraday published first and more fully)</li> <li>Henry goes all in on electromagnets, builds a commerical one that can lift 750 pounds, sells a version useful for separating iron ore.</li> </ul> <p>Henry invents - or rather, is one of several people to invent independently - the relay, a device through which one electrical circuit could control another. His party trick was a 1.5 mile circuit of wire that could trip a little hammer to ring a bell; another similar was a way of causing an electromagnet to suddenly demagnetize, dropping its load</p> <p>Telegraphs - You can't just string a wire up from A to B - You have to take into account how the electricity flows - Messages at a distance became feasible once this was solved</p> <ul> <li>important to note that with electricity you have to think about what Henry and others called 'quantity' and 'intensity' to make electricity travel for long distances; if you wired up a lot of batteries to a magnet, you could pump enough electricity to do work at a distance.</li> <li>for railways, you need to be able to coordinate who's on the same set of tracks so you don't collide</li> </ul> <p>...and now all the pieces are in place.</p> <p>We can:</p> <ul> <li>store electricity</li> <li>induce electricity to travel</li> <li>induce changes in some device at point B by alternating the electricity at point A</li> <li>and because we know magnetic fields and electricity are connected, compass needles are really easy to move with magnetic fields generated by electricity</li> </ul> <p>there is a lot out there on the history of electricity. Especially the 18th and 19th centuries, things get intense. But if you want to know the details about how everything actually works, you can find lots of material pretty fast.</p> <p>What I do want you to think about are the ways today's story could've intersected with monday's, with last week's, other sessions. Every story I tell necessarily leaves things out. This is why your note making matters, why you, if you consider yourself an educated person, must seek out more information, more pieces of the puzzle. Triangulate! Today's story could not have happened without the industrial revolution. Could not have happened without the professionalization of what it means to experiment, to communicate scientific, industrial, engineering knowledge. These people knew or knew of each other, followed their work... what other technologies/emergent social structures had to exist?

The effects of integrating such media into our society produces a culture which is constantly fleeting, devalued, and incomprehensable. </p> <p>In a world where anything is only relevant for six seconds, persevering through a challenge such as climbing a mountain (as you do in the game) becomes increasingly arduous as the reality of actual, tangible failure sets in.

As a middle-schooler, Getting Over It's exploration into how our society has changed really spoke to me in a way that I had never experienced before. It had taught me to not give up, even when it becomes increasingly easy to. Hearing him talk about how information is fleeting, along with our attention, and at the same time presenting a mountain to climb made me set my mind on finishing the game. This was more or less out of spite - \"My attention span is such that I can overcome difficult challenges that don't promise results at any stage of the process and I will prove it even if it's the last thing I do\". So it took over eight hours to complete the game.  The mountain has very few safe points, so the player is constantly in danger of falling right back to the start; this happened very often, but the fact that this failure was consciously added to the game kept me going for some reason.

This chapter addresses the key developments and uses of radio. Beginning with Marconi's successful transmission of the letter \"S\" from England to Newfoundland in 1898, the timeline continues with Fessenden's 1906 successful Christmas Eve radiotelephony transmission from Brant Rock in Massachusetts--the first publicly announced broadcast. Other key historical developments of radio's timeline include the pioneer broadcast station KDKA in Pittsburgh; the formation of the networks and the creation of the radio audience; radio's golden age of programming; the development of FM radio; and the impact of television on the radio industry. Technological advancements are important because they ensure the continued viability of radio. However, these developments must be considered in the light of the role of radio in society. Technological advancements are vital but this must not overshadow the fact that such developments occur in order to serve society. Radio serves society in a variety of capacities: education, entertainment, military affairs, and public affairs such as news and politics. Land-grant universities once envisioned radio as a powerful tool for educating mass numbers of the population. Educational radio stations numbered more than 200 during the early 1920s but dropped to 35 by 1941 due to the lack of funding</p> <p>The first radiotelephony broadcast served an entertainment purpose and consisted of Fessenden playing the violin as well as playing phonograph recordings. Musical artists continue to entertain the public through radio. During World War I, the United States government took control of radio airwaves by ordering amateur operators off the air and authorizing the Navy to exert complete control of what was perceived as a marine service. In 1920 private ownership was restored. During World War II, the American government limited the licensing of new radio stations. Political radio broadcasting began early in the United States during the late 1930s, with political candidates airing radio advertisements. Political radio became a staple of American society as early as 1944 when, due to poor health, FDR relied predominantly on radio to run his fourth successful presidential bid. On election night in 1944, the radio networks dropped regular programming in order to carry the election results. Political radio continues today with recent and current presidents' weekly radio broadcasts and an extensive variety of talk radio shows.  </p> <p>Broadcast journalism developed during World War II. Edward R. Murrow, considered to be the founder of broadcast journalism, became famous for his eloquent and vivid broadcasts describing the bombing of London by Hitler's warplanes. Listeners became so engrossed in Murrow's news coverage that they actually felt as if they were there and experiencing the terror in London. Countries use radio to project their policies and values onto other nations. Future technological advancements include the evolution into digital radio, the increasing value of micro-powered radio stations, and the future of radio and the Internet</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40spikerDevelopmentRadio/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Put any links to separate notes you have teased out here.</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999/","title":"@standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999","text":"<p>Title: @standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999 date: 2023-03-04 type: reference project:</p> <p>tags:: #PartTwo projects:</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40standageVictorianInternetRemarkable1999/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Standage, Tom.

The two-fold answer of contemporary theory is that man \"internalizes\" social norms and seeks a favorable self-image by conforming to the \"expectations\" of others. Such a model of man denies the very possibility of his being anything but a thoroughly socialized being and thus denies the reality of the Hobbesian question. The Freudian view of man, on the other hand, which sociologists have misrepresented, sees man as a social though never a fully socialized creature.

Jonathan Coopersmith recounts the multigenerational, multinational history of the device from its origins to its workplace glory days, in the process revealing how it helped create the accelerated communications, information flow, and vibrant visual culture that characterize our contemporary world. Most people assume that the fax machine originated in the computer and electronics revolution of the late twentieth century, but it was actually invented in 1843. Almost 150 years passed between the fax's invention in England and its widespread adoption in tech-savvy Japan, where it still enjoys a surprising popularity. Over and over again, faxing's promise to deliver messages instantaneously paled before easier, less expensive modes of communication: first telegraphy, then radio and television, and finally digitalization in the form of email, the World Wide Web, and cell phones. By 2010, faxing had largely disappeared, having fallen victim to the same technological and economic processes that had created it. Based on archival research and interviews spanning two centuries and three continents, Coopersmith's book recovers the lost history of a once-ubiquitous technology. Written in accessible language that should appeal to engineers and policymakers as well as historians, Faxed explores themes of technology push and market pull, user-based innovation, and \"blackboxing\" (the packaging of complex skills and technologies into packages designed for novices) while revealing the inventions inspired by the fax, how the demand for fax machines eventually caught up with their availability, and why subsequent shifts in user preferences rendered them mostly passe</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2016/#annotations","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>%% begin annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2016/#imported-on-2023-03-08-207-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-03-08 2:07 pm","text":""},{"location":"Thoughts/Public%20annotations%20from%20%40coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2016/#questions-confusion","title":"Questions / confusion","text":"<p>[!quote|#ffd400] Highlight facsimile</p> <p>What is the definition of Facsimile?</p> <p>Page 1 [[2023-03-05#11:31 am]]</p> <p>[!quote|#ffd400] Highlight Faxing even became a visible component in Japanese techno-imperialism in China</p> <p>What the hell is techno-imperialism??

Therefore, this study utilized the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which has more accurate norms and frequent usage among dual diagnostic patient populations. An on-line survey administered on a World Wide Web site utilized the BDI as part of a larger study. A total of 312 surveys was collected with 259 valid profiles from addicted users, which again supported significant levels of depression to be associated with pathological Internet use. This article discusses how a treatment protocol should emphasis the primary psychiatric condition if related to a subsequent impulse control problem such as pathological Internet use.

It would search for files based on keywords or phrases entered by the user and return a list of matches along with the location and size of the files. The search results were displayed in a hierarchical format, with directories listed first, followed by the files contained within them. This would allow for more effective navigation of the results. ARCHIE quickly gained popularity among the academic community, as it provided an easy way to access a vast repository of research material that was otherwise difficult to find. However, with the advent of the World Wide Web and more advanced search technologies, ARCHIE's popularity waned, and it was eventually replaced by newer search engines.</p> <p>Archie was not originally named after the Archie comic book series, but later developments in this technology took on the names of the series' characters, such as Jughead and Veronica.</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Part%203/Flame%20Wars/","title":"Flame Wars","text":"<p>Flame wars refer to heated arguments or discussions that take place in online forums, social media platforms, or chat rooms.

It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.</p> <p>TCP is connection-oriented, and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent. The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established. Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. TCP employs network congestion avoidance. However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.</p> <p>(From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/Part%203/The%20Fall%20of%20ARPANET/","title":"The Fall of ARPANET","text":"<p>ARPANET's popularity began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Though before this, the National Science Foundation Network replaced ARPANET as the backbone of the internet in 1989</p> <p>Another reason for Arpanet's decline in popularity was the growing concern about security and privacy. As Arpanet's user base expanded, so did the potential for unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Security protocols were put in place, but they were often difficult to use and had limited effectiveness. As a result, many users began to look for alternatives that provided better security features. Additionally, concerns about privacy increased as more people began to use Arpanet for personal communication. While Arpanet was designed primarily for research and academic purposes, it was also being used for personal and commercial communication, which led to concerns about data privacy and confidentiality.
